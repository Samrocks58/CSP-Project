# Terminal Snake

This python-based program works to emulate the famous game snake within the terminal using system packages like msvcrt and os to get real-time user input within the terminal and clear the terminal before printing to make it seem like frames in a video game.

## Background
The main reason I made this program is because I thought it would be an interesting challenge to make an entire functioning game within the terminal. Also, I had heard a story of how the original creator of Tetris used very basic graphics within the terminal to create the original game and thought that was interesting.
